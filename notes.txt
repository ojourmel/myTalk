v0.1
	First alpha release, lot's of bugs... the most notable being chat text will print on your console no matter what application is running eg. man pages...
	   myt does not start the listening servecies automaticaly...
	   lots's of small typos, and no real documentaion within the perl scripts.

v0.1.1
	Seccond alpha release, upgraded the myt and README to include -start, -stat and -kill.
	   also update DOalias to fix the multiple install bug.
           Note: the fix is a little bit ugly, I need to negate the if statment...
	   still typos, and documentation bugs.

v0.1.2 	Minor update to add -who, display all users on otter who are running tailTalk
           Also edits DOalias that cleans some stuff up. Now works on cubs

v0.2.0  Major update: Change interface

         Bug fix. updates tailTalk.cpp --FIXES DOUBLE LINE BUG--
         

         Updates myt to cli standards, ie --start, --stop etc.

           Other major changes... myt -start now spawns a dedicated chat window
              where all output is placed.
              Also adds login and logout mesages in myt.
              Adds the command myt --kill to your ~/.bash_logout when you quit.
           STOPS support for ./starter  now the listening servecies MUST be started
              with myt --start

        KNOWN BUGS: --who will NOT work across systems, it will ONLY give
                      the user names of those who are running on the SAME
                      system that you are.


        Also changes the make file to support update, which will grab the 
         latest copy of the tar file from /home/student/jourmeob/drop/myTalk.tar
         and extract, copy, and self delete.
        NOTE: will ONLY work if tailTalk is NOT running

v0.2.1 Major BUG FIXES  thanks to Lochlin
       Updates starter, DOalias, tailTalk.cpp

       Fixes lag issues, as well as droping messages
       makes make update execute DOalias...

v0.2.2 Added funcitonality, adds option --start-nw
          for a no window myt. tailTalk will be run in background in the
          current terminal
          Usefull for ssh sessions with X11 forwarding disabled.
          Updates the makefile to close tailTalk nicely when updating
          Updates myt --kill to warn if tailTalk is not running


       Also documents a bug in --who, where the username is displayed twice
       even if you are only running one isnstance of tailTalk.
       Because of --who's current broken state, this is not a high priority.

v0.2.3 Breaks all functionality, the will use distibution of v0.2.2 untill 0.2.4

v0.2.4 Added install-nc and update-nc for NoClobber in the makefile
